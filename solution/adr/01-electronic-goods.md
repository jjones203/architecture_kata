# Limiting Storefront to Electronic Goods and Online Rebates

## Status
Accepted

## Context
One of the requirements for the platform is to allow businesses to create a storefront on the application to encourage users to redeem their points. Limiting the number of items available to such storefront will make it easier to integrate with external businesses and boost their adoption of the Hey, Blue! program.

## Decision
Providing storefronts on the Hey, Blue! platform puts the onus on the external businesses to provide a (or an additional) technical solution for their inventory and distribution of goods. Providing these entities with a simple application programming interface (API) and templates for listing gift cards and promo rebate codes removes the need to manage SKUs (stock-keeping units) for the businesses and Hey, Blue!'s technical team.

## Consequences

### Pros
- Seamless adoption from external businesses
- Reduce technical complexity for first implementation of the platform

### Cons
- Less choice for the user
- Less engagement for the user to redeem their points

_Note that the storefront can be expanded to meet the demand once adoption is more prevalent after the initial launch._
