# Using QR Codes For Local Businesses

## Status
Accepted

## Context
While some local businesses may not have an online presense (besides social media), we would like to have users of the Hey, Blue! platform engage with small business owners in order to completely benefit the local communitities. These business would determine a flat discount for the platform users upon sign up and will be provided a QR code, for tracking app-side. When a user visits the local business, they can redeem their points in-person for pre-determined discount.

## Decision
The Hey, Blue! platform focuses on increasing community engagement between police officers and civilian within a community. Creating an incentive for local businesses to participate in the program, without the barrier of having an online shopping presence, will benefit local members of these same communities who also happen to be business owners instead of forcing users of the Hey, Blue! app to only redeem points to big name stores and businesses.

## Consequences

### Pros
- Expand reach of the redeem and rewards program to local businesses
- Drive business to local business owners
- Bring exposure to more diverse variety of goods to Hey, Blue! users
