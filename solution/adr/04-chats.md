# Including a Temporary Chat System for Interaction Coordination

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Whether virtual or in-person, the requirements do not describe a way for a civilian and police officers to exchange niceties for a more meaningful interaction.

## Decision
An internal and short lived chat window will be enabled when a civilian and a police officer agree to conduct an interaction. For a virtual handshake, it will allow to the two parties to exchange words to bring about a more meaningful and memorable interaction. For an in-person interaction, it will also allow the two parties to agree on a place to meet. It allows to keep the full interaction inside the Hey, Blue! platform for benefit and safety of both the civilian and police officer. The chat between these two user will only be temporary and disabled once an interaction has concluded. Records of the chat will be kept as required by local juridiction.

## Consequences

### Pros
- Ability to coordinate interaction plans between a civilian and a police officer
- Add personal touch to virtual handshake
- Optional
