# Including a Temporary Chat System for Interaction Coordination

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Whether virtual or in-person, the requirements do not describe a way for a civilian and police officers to exchange niceties for a more meaningful interaction.

## Decision
An internal and short lived chat window will be enabled when a civilian and a police officer agree to interact:
- For a virtual handshake, the two parties may exchange greetings. 
- For an in-person interaction, the two parties can agree on a place to meet. The platform will not disclose real-time location information for security reasons. Furthermore, coordinating to meet at a mutually convenient location makes interactions more feasible in suburban and rural communities where neighborhoods are not walkable and distances may be great. 

The full interaction will occur inside the Hey, Blue! platform for the safety of both the civilian and police officer. The chat between these two users will be temporary; it will be disabled after an interaction has concluded or a period of inactivity. Records of the chat will be kept as required by local jurisdiction.

## Consequences

### Pros
- Ability to coordinate plans for in-person interaction between a civilian and a police officer
- Option to add a personal touch to virtual handshake

### Cons
- Users must engage in chat to coordinate in-person interactions
- Higher barriers to entry for users who are not literate in English or who are visually impaired
