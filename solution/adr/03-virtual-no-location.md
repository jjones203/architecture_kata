# Limiting Interactions to Virtual Handshakes When No Geolocation Tracking

## Status
Accepted

## Context
There will be instances where users will be using the Hey, Blue! platform from their web browser, either on their phone or from a computer. This should not prevent users from virtually connecting, when within the same ZIP code.

_This ADR is related to [05 - Limiting Application Functionality on the Web](./05-limited-web-functionality.md)._

## Decision
The Hey, Blue! platform will allow for such interaction to again limit the barrier to entry and empower users to interact with community police officer, even if only to exchange a few words and have a virtual handshake.

## Consequences

### Pros
- Remove another friction point for interactions
- Lower barrier of entry for users
