# Strategy

Responsiveness is paramount for a near-real time platform like Hey, Blue! is planning to achieve. From geolocation tracking to live interactions between users, the platform will need to feel responsive and easily scale with the eventual increase in participation. Its core cannot rely on REST APIs interacting with one another as simple micro-services, but instead it should model itself after large-scale messaging systems, such as Discord and WhatsApp. Our strategy is to design Hey, Blue!'s architecture as an event-driven architecture, with its workflows directed by mediator(s). These live messaging services do use similar approaches for their backend services, and we believe it would future-proof the Hey, Blue! platform. Although the increase in complexity for such an architecture is noteworthy, the improved availability, responsiveness and workflow at scale are worth the complexity cost.
