# Strategy

Responsiveness is paramount for the near-real time platform Hey, Blue! envisions. From geolocation tracking to live interactions between users, the platform will need to feel responsive and easily scale with the eventual increase in participation. Its core cannot rely on REST APIs interacting with one another as simple micro-services, but instead it should model itself after large-scale messaging systems, such as Discord and WhatsApp. Therefore we propose an event-driven architecture, with its workflows directed by mediators. Existing live messaging services use similar approaches for their backend services, and we believe it would future-proof the Hey, Blue! platform. Although the increase in complexity for such an architecture is noteworthy, the improved availability, responsiveness and workflow at scale are worth the complexity cost.
