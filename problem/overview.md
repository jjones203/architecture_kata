# Overview

## Hey, Blue! Vision
The Hey, Blue! initiative facilitates moments of meaningful connection between police officers and members of their community by offering intentional opportunities for individuals to meet and share positive experiences.

## Context
In 2014, Barack Obama convened the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing in response to the shooting of Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, and subsequent protests. The Task Force produced [recommendations](https://cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/taskforce/taskforce_finalreport.pdf) for policing practices that could reduce crime and increase public trust. Several recommendations centered on increased community engagement, including "positive nonenforcement activities" such as Coffee with a Cop. In a 2019 [study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1910157116), more informal positive nonenforcement activities improved civilians' opinions of and willingness to cooperate with police; the effect lasted through a 21-day follow-up period.

The President's Task Force noted that technology provides a potential avenue for community engagement. Hey, Blue! harnesses technology to bring civilians and police officers together, making positive nonenforcement activities convenient, fun, and rewarding.
