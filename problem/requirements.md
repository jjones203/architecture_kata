# Goals
As stated in the [requirements doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10o-4eEzFo005pqDt_ORCztzaQCQ_9FNWYrxFasou3Eo/edit#), the Hey, Blue! mobile app and website will enable:
- civilians and law enforcement officers to have positive interactions, which will be rewarded with Hey, Blue! points
- civilians to exchange Hey, Blue! points for goods, services, and discounts
- law enforcement officers to donate points to charities, optionally earmarking specific recipients
- charities to exchange donated points for goods, services, and discounts
- Hey, Blue! administrators to view platform usage statistics

# Privacy and Safety Concerns
Users can arrange to meet in person via chat. Users cannot track each others' location in real time, and both parties must consent to chat.

## User Privacy
As a non-profit, Hey, Blue! will not be subject to some privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act. Due to additional regulations governing children's privacy (e.g., the Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Act), Hey, Blue! will require users to attest that they are at least 18 years of age when registering.

## Officer Safety
All civilian-officer interactions will be posted to Hey, Blue!'s social media. However, the post will include only the users' first names or nicknames, it will not include a photo unless both parties agree, and an automatic 15-minute delay will ensure officers' locations are not trackable via social media. When an officer is logged into the mobile app with location tracking enabled, the app will send an alert after 15 minutes of inactivity; if the officer does not click on a button confirming they are active, they will be automatically logged out.
